# Night Owl Surveillance System

The surveillance system used in this project was a Night Owl AHD10 Series. It is a four-channel (four camera) system that oversaw the project as an eagle-eye and was not hacked during the exercise. It has upwards of 190+ hours of recording time and will record only when triggered by the motion sensor in the camera.

The placement of the cameras focuses on four of the six rooms and corridors:

- The first room: Channel 1 Camera; contains the Bluetooth lock, Amazon Alexa, and home laptop
- The first hallway: Motion Sensor
- The second room: Channel 2 Camera; Light/Temperature sensor
- The second hallway: Channel 3 Camera; Nerf Gun
- The third room: Channel 4 Camera; Manny Kin

The surveillance feed (live and archive) can be best viewed by a number of methods.
